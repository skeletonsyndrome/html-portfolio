<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born on a Friday in the year 2000. It's been 2 decades since I've been roaming around planet earth. Currently I am doing a web development course.</p>

<p>This Web development course is quite enjoyable and I enjoy the style of teaching. There are immediate indicators to show if you passed or failed, so it's a lot like
  playing a video game. The course mainly takes a Behaviorist approach to learning but there are also some aspects Constructivism as well since Angela has built a 
  community around this course.
